## About me:
I'm 34 years old man from Minsk, Belarus. 
1.5 years moved to Warsaw, Poland. 
I thought about learning programming about 6 years ago, but something always prevented me, just at that time we were waiting for our daughter.
But now, working in Poland as a courier (quite a physically demanding job). I realized that I should stop waiting for a miracle, so I started to learn JavaScript with RSSchool.
